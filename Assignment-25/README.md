## Assignment
This assignment will pick up where we left off. We have successfully implemented an `open()` syscall and will now pair that with a `write()` sycall to insert text into our open file.

## Getting Started
Again, we will reference the noob friendly [codewiki](http://codewiki.wikidot.com/c:system-calls:write) site.
