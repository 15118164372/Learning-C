## Assignment 6
Prompt the user for A, B, and C values and then use those values to determine the value of 'X' using the [Quadratic Formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_formula). 

If you need to brush up on the Quadratic Formula, hit up [Khan Academy!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iulx0z1lz8M)

Hint: Make your life easier by including the `math.h` header file. You may have to search online for an additional flag for `gcc` to get your code compiled correctly!

Extra Credit: Build in a mechanism for checking your solutions which takes the answer and plugs it back into the Formula and hopefully equals `0`. Use `if` control flow to check the answer and print the solution. If your program fails to check the solution, tell the user to double-check themselves. 

## Example Output
```terminal_session
tokyo:~/LearningC/ # ./assignment6                                   
Enter the value of variable 'A': -7
Enter the value of variable 'B': 2
Enter the value of variable 'C': 9
The solution using the '+' operator is: -1.000000
The solution using the '-' operator is: 1.285714, but you might want to double-check that...
